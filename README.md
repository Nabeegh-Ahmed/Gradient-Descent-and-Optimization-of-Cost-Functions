# Gradient-Descent-and-Optimization-of-Cost-Functions

This notebook is a collection of cost functions that are used in AI and ML models to monitor and minimize the cost and maximize speed of learning. The notebook walks you through some of the example cost cost functions and how their cost can be minimized using Gradient Descent algorithm.
